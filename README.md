# Ethereum(ERC-20)-wallet-dashboard
A Ethereum/ERC-20 wallet dashboard that shows, in depth balance and summary of all added wallets, without the hassle of opening every wallet and seeing balances. Just enter your public wallet address and it is saved with you. All new token will appear automatically unlike blockfloio where you have to add new tokens.

Simple add your public address of all ERC-20/Ethereum wallets and it will show you all the tokens you currently hold. Everything is client side so your public address is safe with you, nothing is stored on any server.
